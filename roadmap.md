# Roadmap
A list a future projects/features:

## Implementing a web UI
This probably never going to happen or in like ten years. This is extremely hard to do. One approach would be to use (or have it based on) something like [BlueMap]. I've already talked to the creator of [BlueMap]. It's just really hard to change some [BlueMap] source code without even knowing any [Vue].
