# Mojang Maps

> This wiki is currently in beta.
{: .warning}

_A Google Maps like navigation system for Minecraft._

## Run Mojang Maps

To run Mojang Maps, youÂ´ll need to (have) set up a [SpigotMC] or [PaperMC] Minecraft server. After that download [the latest Mojang Maps release] and place it in your `plugins` folder. To set up a road system and configure Mojang Maps, please see [the getting started page].

If your server has no access to the internet/GitHub.com, please see [Using/Setting up Mojang Maps on a server without access to the internet. - Advanced/Custom].

## About Mojang Maps/FAQ

Mojang Maps is a Google Maps like navigation system for Minecraft.

### Why did I start Mojang Maps?

I started Mojang Maps as a weird idea that had a high change I wouldn't make it. I heard about things like [Dijkstra's Algorithm]. It was just this weird idea that was stuck in my head. At the time I had done here and there some [Spigot]/Bukkit work, but never really worked on a project.

It started with me just finding a way to store locations and implementing [Dijkstra's Algorithm] with [this video] ([commit febb798]). After that I started adding roads and asked [ChatGPT] how to turn a list of directions to one direction to one point ([version 1.0]). Added a language system and showed on which road you were ([version 1.1] and [version 1.3]).

I'm currently working on a GUI, to make Mojang Maps more accessible.

For future projects please see [the roadmap].

### Why the name Mojang Maps?

Google Maps is made by Google. Minecraft is made by Mojang. It is Google Maps for Minecraft, so Mojang Maps.

Reason I haven't changed it: I haven't yet gotten a cease and desist letter from Mojang yet to stop using their name, so I just use this name.

### How can I support Mojang Maps?

You can donate with PayPal, or just help by [translating] or writing code.
